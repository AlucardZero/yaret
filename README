A Unix system with Perl and MySQL is required.  The following Perl modules are
also required. If you do not have them, install them via CPAN or your 
distribution's package manager if available:

* JSON::XS
* LWP::UserAgent
* POSIX 
* DateTime
* CGI
* File::Temp
* Config::Simple
* DBD::mysql
* File::Temp
* Time::HiRes
* File::Copy

INSTALL:

1. Make sure you have Perl, MySQL, and the above Perl modules installed
2. Create a database (example: "yaret") and DB user (example: "yaret").
3. Import yaret-initial.sql into this database. Example:
        mysql -u ret -p ret < yaret-initial.sql
4. Move ret.conf.dist to ret.conf and fill in the values.
5. Add a cron job to run events.pl. Example:
        * * * * * /home/alucard/rift/events.pl

HTML files for each datacenter (na and eu) are generated and put under
/var/www/rift/ by default. You can change this destination by editing 
events.pl.  Include a trailing slash.

Thanks to RiftPluz for collecting most of the translations in one place.
