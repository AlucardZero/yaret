Yet Another Rift Event Tracker

This one in Perl and with more colored events.

See LICENSE for license details.

See live version @ http://kiserai.net/rift

A Unix system with Perl is required.  The following Perl modules are also
required. If you do not have them, install them via CPAN or your distribution's
package manager if available:

* JSON::XS
* LWP::UserAgent
* POSIX 
* DateTime
* CGI
* File::Temp
* Config::Simple
* DBD::mysql

History tracking is done via MySQL.  Set up a database and user and fill in the
values in ret.conf.  This support is optional (set SQLENABLE=false).

Run the script with perl, preferably via cron.  HTML files for each datacenter
(na and eu) are generated and put in /var/www/rift/ by default. You should
change this destination by editing events.pl.  Include a trailing slash.

Thanks to RiftPluz for collecting the translations in one place.
