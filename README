A Unix system with Perl and MySQL is required.  The following Perl modules are

distribution's package manager if available:

* DateTime
* CGI
* File::Temp
* Config::Simple
* DBD::mysql
* File::Temp
* Time::HiRes
* File::Copy

INSTALL:

0. Make sure you have Perl, MySQL, and the above Perl modules installed
1. Create a database (example: "ret") and DB user (example: "ret").
2. Import the table.sql into this database.
3. Move ret.conf.dist to ret.conf and fill in the values.
4. Add a cron job to run events.pl. Example:
        * * * * * /home/alucard/rift/events.pl

HTML files for each datacenter (na and eu) are generated and put under
/var/www/rift/ by default. You can change this destination by editing 
events.pl.  Include a trailing slash.

Thanks to RiftPluz for collecting most of the translations in one place.
