Yet Another Rift Event Tracker

This one in Perl, with more colored events, and with history tracking.

See LICENSE for license details.

See live version @ http://kiserai.net/rift

A Unix system with Perl and MySQL is required.  The following Perl modules are
also required. If you do not have them, install them via CPAN or your 
distribution's package manager if available:

* JSON::XS
* LWP::UserAgent
* POSIX 
* DateTime
* CGI
* File::Temp
* Config::Simple
* DBD::mysql
* File::Temp
* Time::HiRes
* File::Copy

History tracking is done via MySQL.  Set up a database and user and fill in the
values in ret.conf.

Move ret.conf.dist to ret.conf and fill in the values.

Run the script with perl, preferably via cron.  HTML files for each datacenter
(na and eu) are generated and put in /var/www/rift/ by default. You should
change this destination by editing events.pl.  Include a trailing slash.

Thanks to RiftPluz for collecting most of the translations in one place.
